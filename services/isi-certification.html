            The ISI label is by far the most known recognition mark for the
            quality of the product in the Indian subcontinent. The ISI tag shall
            be published by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). There are 150
            compulsory goods that need ISI certification before being sold in
            India.

            How to get ISI Registration?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The manufacturer(s) must complete the testing and documentation
            required by BIS in order to approve the product on the ISI
            Certification. The factory will also need to be physically audited
            by the BIS officer. EVTL India is an established ISI certification
            service provider for both Indian and international manufacturers. We
            help manage any process required to obtain ISI Certification for
            products included in the mandatory list or other optional products
            for which Indian Standard is eligible. For details, please check the
            Important Information given below.

                    The BIS grants ISI Mark based on successful assessment of
                    the manufacturing infrastructure, production process,
                    quality control and in-house testing capabilities of a
                    manufacturer. These are ascertained through a visit to the
                    manufacturing premises. Conformity of the product to the
                    relevant Indian Standard(s) is also established through
                    independent laboratory testing or testing in the
                    manufacturer’s premises or a combination of both.

                    The tested samples have to be collected back within 1 month
                    from the date of issue of test report. After 1 month, the
                    lab reserves the right to destroy the sample as per its
                    policy and no claim will be entertained afterwards.

                  <p>
                    Further, the sample may be partially or fully damaged during
                    the testing. Lab or Elixir Certifications will not entertain
